# 🏥 Hospital Readmission Risk Predictor

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a patient is at **high or low risk of hospital readmission**, based on demographic and clinical data.

Built with **Streamlit** for a user-friendly web interface and trained using a **Random Forest classifier** on a synthetic healthcare dataset.
